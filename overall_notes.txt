----------SUPERVISIED LEARNING----------


a raw datset  should be divided as 

FEATURES/LABELS 

FEATURES -> the characteristics for example in mango (colour and weight) 
LABELS -> Supervision for example in mango (lable = ripe or raw)
this two plays a major role in the Supervisied learning 


ALGOTITHM -> VALIMURAI in tamil 
can be defined as LEARNING ALGOTITHM

algorithm input -> is called as Training set -> the Training data  or data set 

algorithm output -> is called as model ->  if the input (datset) is given then the ouput is called as model 

test - instance -> FEATURES -> MODEL -> PREDICTION 

----------UNSUPERVISIED LEARNING----------

it doesn't have labels it guesses from the clustering (grouping similar objects)

uses 
SEGEMENTATION: giving a image and finding the  foreground and background
by giving a video of containing animals roaming in the forest and the UNSUPERVISIED modle can 
split the video as foreground and background for tracking the animals and SEGEMENTATION 

----------TYPES OF SUPERVISIED LEARNING-----------
the models in the Supervisied learning can be defined by the labels it have and these labels will decide the 
algorithms 

1.CLASSIFICATION
for example we can take the mango as example 

BINARY CLASSIFICATION -> in email we have spam filtering and we filter the email based on only two labels that is spam or 
not spam , so here we have 2 lables so that we can simply conclude this as BINARY CLASSIFICATION and BI means 2 so only 2 labels.

MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION -> in a post code there can be only 6 digits and its a combination of 0 to 9 letters and we have totally 9 labels 
from 0 to 9 so that we have 10 labels and its called as MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION

2.REGRESSION 
for example we have  a table contating the details about coulmns like 

day apple  orange  pinapple    total amount 
1	2	   1	   3	       125
2	3	   2	   2	       165
3	1	   3	   1	       144
4	2	   1	   2	       186
5	3	   2	   1	       174
6	1	   3	   3	       134
7	3	   2	   1	       ??? -> REAL NUMBER

so now we have find the DAY-7 price in the lables so here we dont have the lables and we have only the trining data from day 1 to day 6 
and now if we have to calculate the DAY-7 price we have the training data and based on that we can get the day-7 price and this method is 
called as the REGRESSION and the number which we have as the price is called as the REAL NUMBER.

BASICS OF MACHINE LEARNING :
1.LINEAR ALGEBRA -> medain lines in all dimensions for 2d is a line for 3d is a plane and for nd is a hyperplane . structure = line ,   
2.PROABABILITY   -> so when we have a  missing data and some of incorrect data this data is called as the uncertainity data and to understand these types of data the probability is used here 
3.OPTIMIZATION   -> so in ml we may have the n number of median lines to choose the best line the optimization is used here 

--------PROABABILITY--------

1.SAMPLE SPACE -> by tossing a coin we can get either heads or tail so this output is 2 and this is called as the SAMPLE SPACE 
SAMPLE SPACE = {H,T}
H & T = outcomes 

2.EVENT SPACE 
event 1 = {H} 
event 2 = {T}
event 3 = {H,T}
event 4 = {nothing} 
these all events are called EVENT SPACE 

3.PROABABILITY SPACE -> the chance of getting this outcomes
for example : { {H=50%} , {T=50%} , {H,T=100%} , {0=0} }

another example for the probability is the dice rolling 
sample space -> {1,2,3,4,5,6}
event space -> {combinations}
no of events -> 2^6 


CONDITIONAL PROABABILITY : 
p(A given B) -- P(A|B)
if B acts and completed what could be the changes that made in the event A 
in simple words the change in event B how occurs the changes in  the probability of A 

DICE ROOL : A = {1,2} and B = {2,4,6}
P(A) = 1/6 and P(B) = 1/2

now P(A|B) = 1/3 
so if the b gives the output of the even number then the probability of the A is increases 
so in simple words what is the possibility of A occurs in B 

P(A|B) = P(A n B) / P(B)

example : 
A = {2,4,6} (3/6) and B = {1,2,3,4} (4/6)

P(A) = 1/2  
P(B) = 2/3

P(A|B) = P(A n B) / P(B)  => P({2,4}) / P({1,2,3,4}) => (2/6) / (4/6) = 3/4 = 1/2

P(A|B) = 1/2

if the there is no change between the events then the events are called as the Independent events
P(A|B) = P(A)

BAYES THEOREM :

P(A|B) = P(A n B) / P(B) 

P(B|A) = P(B n A) / P(A)

bayes theroem formula => P(A|B) = [P(B|A) / P(B)] X P(A)

so the bayes theroem is used to simplyfy the conditional probability equation by elemination the 
equation and its used when it comes to the large problems where is the data is not fully mentioned 

If you're given the joint probability 𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵) directly (like the probability of both A and B happening together), 
and you also know the marginal probability P(B), you can directly apply the formula to find P(A∣B).

P(A|B) = POSTERIOR conditional probability -> The updated belief about which line (A) is better after evaluating the dataset 𝐵.

P(B|A) / P(B) = likelihood ->  How well the data B supports the idea that the line A is the best fit.
that mean how the equeated values matching the prior predictied probability lines

P(A) = PRIOR -> Your initial belief about which line (A) is better, before considering the dataset 𝐵.


--------- COUNTINIOUS PROABABILITY DISTRIBUTION ---------
#finite --> values that can countable

so here the values is not countable that mean we don't know about the values 
for example : 
sample space : [0,10]
E -> event  space : {all intervals [a,b]}

probability density function : to give the probability of any event 

it assocates the value for the sample space with the actual value for example 
from 1 to 10 it puts as 1/10 and after 10 it will put as 0/10 as 

f(x) = 1/10 if 0 <= x <= 10 
= 0 otherwise 

if im asking a random probability (A , B) of a sample space it will work like 

first it takes the area b/w A and B and the area is the probability 
and that area is mentioned as the Area Under the Curve 

the area is a like rectange the area = length x breadth that is 

p([A,B]) = (B-A/10)

for (1,3) -> p([1,3]) = (3-1/10) = (2/10) = 1/5


---------- GUASSIAN DISTRIBUTION ----------
for using to quantify the uncertainity and its used in countinous probability and 
it uses the bell curve, by taking the mean value it forms the bell shape curve.

"The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is one of the most important and commonly used probability distributions
in statistics and machine learning. It describes how data values are distributed around a mean (average) in a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve."

SO FOR ONLY COUNT FROM SAMPLE SPACE WE USE THE -- PDF -- AND WE FROM -INFINITY TO +INFINITY WE USE -- GUASSIAN DISTRIBUTION -- 

NEXT FUNDAMENTAL THING FOR MACHINE LEANRING 

---------- LINEAR ALGEBRA ----------

in simple word the Linear Algebra is the study about the lines that divides the two sets

vector = is about the numerical represnation of the data that have both magnitude and direction in same time 

vector addition ( to find the diffrence between 2 vectors )

V1 = V2 + V3 

WEIGHT , magnitude and pythores thorem is about the 
[10,20] = root of 10^2 + 20^2 

SPAN OF VECTOR :
by taking a vector as representative and multiplying that with other all values and 
we putting all this in a bag is called span and the the value is V .


---------- LINEAR INDEPENDENCE ----------

a set of vectors {v1,v2,v3,.....,vn} in a Ndimension is linearly Independent when 
if c1 u1 + c2 u2 + c3 u3 + ...... + cn un = 0 
   c1,c2,c3,cn = 0
if all c1 is 0 then its linearly Independent
by taking other than this method to derive the 0 is called 
linearly dependent 

let u = {u1,u2,u3,...,un} be linearly Independent vectors such that 

span({u1,u2,u3}) = r^d 
then span(u) = r^d 

then u is called the basis of r^d 

to show a set of vectors as basis we have to prove that 
that vectors as linearly Independent or the vectors are span(u) = r^d
